# MCP_Embed_PoC
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) was developed and implemented to interface with an Arduino microcontroller. This PoC demonstrates successful control of actuators (LEDs) and acquisition of sensor data (IR sensors) using the MCP framework, validating the feasibility of this approach for future applications.
